# NCW Safe Eats

NCW Safe Eats is a public food safety lookup tool for **North Central Washington**, including:

- Wenatchee  
- East Wenatchee  
- Chelan & Manson  
- Leavenworth

The site makes local restaurant inspection reports easy to understand by showing:

This project was inspired by **Seattle Safe Eats** and exists to help residents — especially immunocompromised individuals — choose safer places to eat.
